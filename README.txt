1. I used Visual Studio 2015 and MS SQL Server 2014
2. Please attached the database mdf file from the database folder
3. I've reused Generic Repository Pattern that I discovered online in 2010 
4. I used structuremap for the Dependency Injection
5. I used nunit framework for testing and resharper as my test runner
6. I based the code pattern in the Ebook ASP.NET 3.5 Enterprise Application Development with Visual Studio 2008: Problem Design Solution
7. I build Web Applicaitons based on this code pattern in 2010

Thanks.
